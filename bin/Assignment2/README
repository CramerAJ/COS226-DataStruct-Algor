226 Assingment 2

MyTreeNode:
Filled all methods, using the TreeNode.java implementation.
Had certain Methods call each other, if needed to illustrate object orienting programming.
Had my child be equal to the left child, and sibling equal to the right sibling.

MyTree:
Used MyTree methods from Tree.java, and had them call MyTreeNode Methods, in order to get size(), height(),
 and the children nodes over to be used, to check if its empty.
 MyTree, also sets the tree_root equal to the node, of the first one given, and 
 is set as the root unless told to be changed at a different time.
 
BST:
Used similar code from an assignment I did in 225, as well as looked up on how to build
a binary search tree. Was trying to have this call my F1to8 class, and use the functions, to output
the tree, with regards to the function they have.

F1to8:
Tried to a getRight(), getLeft(), and then setLeft() and setRight() it to the parameter e, with the <String>.
had the BinarySearchTree(BST)

BTreeNode:
Is a binary search tree that has its setLeft, setRight(), and getRight(), and getLeft().
Used by the F1to8, to implement the functions.
Tried to make something as best as I could with regards to the question.
BTreeNode<E>, is used in BST(BinarySearchTree Class), as well as the F1to8, used to run the functions
through and create a tree.
